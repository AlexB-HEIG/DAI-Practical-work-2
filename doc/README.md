## Section 1 - Overview

The "Tic Tac Toe" protocol is a communication protocol that allows clients to play tic-tac-toe on a server together.

## Section 2 - Transport protocol

The "Tic Tac Toe" protocol is a text transport protocol. It uses the TCP transport protocol to ensure the reliability of data transmission. The port it uses is the port number 6433.  

Every message must be encoded in UTF-8 and delimited by a newline character (`\n`). The messages are treated as text messages.

The initial connection must be established by the clients.

Once the connection is established, the client is attributed an ID.

Another client can connect to the same server and will be attributed another ID.

The client can send a message to the server indicating what to do.

For example,  choose the size of the board(min 3 and max 9).

The board is generated.

A loop will initiate, where:
- A player will make a move 
- His board is updated
- The other player will be notified of the move
- The other player's board is updated

A move is communicated using X, the column, and Y, the line, with the format `X Y`.

Another format will send back an error.

An error can also be sent, if a player tries to put his symbol in a space that is already occupied.

After each move, the application will check for a win.

If the maximum number of moves is reached, the game will be determined to be a draw.

After a game has finished, the Player 1 can choose to begin another game, where they can put the same size of board or change it, or exit.

> [!NOTE]  
> 
> The network connection can be closed on both sides (client and server).
